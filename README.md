Proposal
-----------------
We propose a simple objective based video game. The game should have a well defined objective with at least 3 distinct levels. An enemy unit (or units) should be defined to give the game a level of difficulty. The main character in the game should have a unique weapon to give the player a sense of power and a tool with which to achieve the game objective. Along with this should be a leveling system so that the player grows stronger over the course of the game. At the end of the game there should be a final boss fight.

Running the Game Locally
------------------------
If the game is running slowly (or not at all) on one of our hosts, you can run the game locally on your machine.

Clone the repo: 

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/CLaverdiere/Four-to-the-Fifth.git
```

Host the game on your localhost. We've just been using Python: 

``` bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Or, if you're on Python 3: 

``` bash
python -m http.server
```

Play the game. 

``` bash
chrome ./game.html
```
